In a developer's life, shell scripts can be incredibly useful for automating repetitive tasks, managing environments, deploying applications, and much more. Here are some examples of complex shell scripts that developers might find useful:

### 1. Deployment Automation:

Shell scripts can be used to automate the deployment process of applications, including tasks like building, testing, and deploying code to various environments.


        #!/bin/bash

        # Deployment script for a web application

        # Build the application
        ./build.sh

        # Run tests
        ./run_tests.sh

        # Deploy to staging environment
        ./deploy.sh staging

        # Run smoke tests on staging
        ./smoke_tests.sh staging

        # If smoke tests pass, deploy to production
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            ./deploy.sh production
        fi

### 2. Environment Setup:

Shell scripts can automate the setup of development environments, including installing dependencies, configuring settings, and initializing databases.

        #!/bin/bash

        # Environment setup script for a project

        # Install dependencies
        npm install

        # Configure environment variables
        export DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/my_database"

        # Initialize database
        ./init_db.sh

### 3. Log Analysis:

Shell scripts can analyze log files to extract useful information, identify patterns, and generate reports.

        #!/bin/bash

        # Log analysis script

        # Count number of error messages
        error_count=$(grep -c "ERROR" access.log)

        # Extract IP addresses with the most requests
        top_ips=$(awk '{print $1}' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head)

        echo "Number of errors: $error_count"
        echo "Top IP addresses:"
        echo "$top_ips"

### 4. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline:

Shell scripts can be used as part of a CI pipeline to automate tasks such as code linting, testing, and deployment.

        #!/bin/bash

        # CI pipeline script

        # Run code linting
        ./lint.sh

        # Run unit tests
        ./test.sh

        # If tests pass, deploy to staging
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            ./deploy.sh staging
        fi

### 5. Backup and Maintenance:

Shell scripts can automate backup tasks, such as creating backups of databases, files, and configurations, as well as performing routine maintenance tasks.

        #!/bin/bash

        # Backup and maintenance script

        # Backup database
        ./backup_db.sh

        # Archive log files older than 7 days
        find /var/log -type f -mtime +7 -exec gzip {} \;

        # Remove old backups
        find /backup -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm {} \;

These examples demonstrate how shell scripts can be used in various scenarios throughout a developer's workflow to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and ensure consistency. With shell scripting, developers can save time and reduce the risk of human error in repetitive tasks.
